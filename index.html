  This is the founder of LunarCrafts, Dora the Explorer.<br>
She is a young woman from Molepolole and the company was founded yesterday, after she realised she has a passion for stuffed animals and would like to make them accessible to the world while making an income from it. All stuffed animals are locally manufactured using recyclable materials.Her daily motivation is her child, Boots who equally loves and shows keen interest in stuff animals.</p>
