  This is the founder of LunarCrafts, Dora.<br>
She is a young woman from Molepolole.Ever since she was a little girl, Dora found comfort in the warm embrace of teddy bears.<br>
Her first bear, a soft grey plush named Boots, was a gift from her grandmother on her third birthday. Through every scraped knee, every thunderstorm, and every whispered childhood secret, Boots was always there—her silent protector and dearest friend.<br>
As Dora grew older, her love for teddy bears never faded. Instead, it blossomed into a passion for collecting rare and unique bears from all over the world.<br>
One day, she realized that her passion could bring joy to others as well. And so, with a heart full of nostalgia and excitement, she started her own teddy bear reselling company in 2020, determined to spread warmth, comfort, and childhood magic—one bear at a time.<br>
Now, every bear she finds isn't just a toy; it's a story waiting to be continued. Just like Boots was for her, she hopes her bears will become lifelong friends to those who need them most..</p>
  
 <p>At LunarCrafts, we believe that every teddy bear holds a story, a memory, and a hug waiting to be shared. As a dedicated reseller of high-quality, collectible, and pre-loved teddy bears, we bring cherished companions to new homes, ensuring that every bear finds someone to love.
Whether you're searching for a rare collector’s item, a nostalgic childhood favorite, or a cuddly friend for a loved one, we carefully curate our collection to offer the best selection. Our passion for teddy bears goes beyond business—it's about preserving the magic, comfort, and joy they bring.
Join us on this heartwarming journey, and let’s find the perfect teddy bear for you</p>
